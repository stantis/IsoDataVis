# README
Data visualization guidelines for stable isotopes graphs, with examples.

Check out the DataVis.Rmd which created the html output and also has the code used for creating different parts of a stable isotopes graph. 

You can use my thesis data to double-check your understanding (and the clarity of my explanations)- it's cleaned already in Excel and .RData formats in the repository. 

This is my first 'real' repository, so all of the apologies are in order.
